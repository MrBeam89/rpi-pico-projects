Random stuff with the Raspberry Pi Pico
## Python scripts
I recommend **Thonny** since it's the easiest to use (for me, at least). Check it out [here](https://thonny.org).

You can install MicroPython directly from Thonny (see Setup Thonny).

### Setup Thonny
1. Plug your Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer and start Thonny.
2. Click on "Local Python 3 • Thonny's Python and click Install Micropython".
3. Click on the dropdown menu beside "variant" and select whatever variant you need.
4. Click on the dropdown menu beside version and choose the latest version.
5. Click Install and wait until it's finished.
6. Now that MicroPython is installed, click again on "Local Python 3 • Thonny's Python and click Install Micropython" and select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)".
7. Done!
